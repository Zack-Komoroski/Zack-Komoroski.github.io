#### Myself
    *Hello, I'm Zack Komoroski, a Freshman at the University of Missouri.*
    I am originally from Cleveland, Ohio. I graduated High School in 2019 from Gilmour Academy. I am majoring in Information Technology while acquiring a Minor in History. I hope to make a career in anything related towards Technology and I see the University of Missouri helping me with that.
